	I love the story here about Xerox PARC. I will readily admit to being slightly biased against apple, but the story of the GUI’s invention is super interesting. I also love old computers and that kind of retro aesthetic so I’m kind of primed for it. On the subject of actual coding, it's really confusing. Mostly, I think it is because it's totally different from python. That said with the help of the internet I do think I’m getting the hang of the very basics of CSS and HTML. <p>

The user interface continues to be  really interesting. I’ve never thought about what Terminal actually was before. It’s fascinating seeing how the internet and websites are stitched together and how such an important and influential part of the world is built on the back of these languages. Honestly, I’ve been thinking about how the building of the internet has affected and changes in web culture a lot more as of lately. In addition, learning about the different building blocks of CSS and HTML has been a whole lot of fun, though admittedly frustrating at times. I’m looking forward to building up my website and maybe figuring out a way to link it or connect it with what Alex is doing. <p>

So that’s what the console was. So much of my experience in Comp Sci this year has
been “OH MY GOD THAT'S WHAT THAT THING ACTUALLY WAS.” It's a lot of fun. Javascript is also nice, because it is more similar to python which I’m used to. The clicky thing went pretty well. I don't have too much more to write about though admittedly I do need help with the animations. Also I had the greatest idea ever about linking Alex and I’s websites.<p>

I made a fantasy themed card for my friend. I had it change the AI fantasy landscape every time you click with a few happy messages for them. It wasn't very difficult and worked pretty well. For next time I'll want to make it more dynamic and respond to more user interactions (maybe some kind of scrolling shift like Alex's website).

The music player thing was a lot of fun. Between the cursor and the music player I can really see my ability to digitally design things exponentially growing. This week I've been super busy but when I'm finished with it I'm really excited to go a lot farther and start really fleshing out my website with more cool stuff and figuring out new interactvity and design on my own, online.
